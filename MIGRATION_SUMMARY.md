# Sportland Code Reorganization - Migration Summary

**Date:** January 2, 2026
**Status:** ✅ Complete

> **Historical record.** This describes a one-off reorganization that has long since
> landed, and the structure below has since changed again — the `HubWorld/` and
> `Management/` folders it plans were never built, and Dodgeball, Demoball, Tag, Career,
> and Hub arrived afterwards. For the current layout see
> [`Assets/Scripts/README.md`](Assets/Scripts/README.md) and [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Overview

Successfully reorganized the Sportland codebase from a flat structure into a hierarchical, scalable architecture that supports multi-sport gameplay, hub world management, and future system expansion.

## What Changed

### Folder Structure

**Before:**
```
Assets/Scripts/
├── Basketball/      # Single sport implementation
├── Core/            # All core systems mixed together
└── UI/              # All UI mixed together
```

**After:**
```
Assets/Scripts/
├── Core/
│   ├── GameManagement/    # Game lifecycle (CoreGameManager, ISportModule)
│   ├── Athlete/           # Athlete data
│   ├── Flags/             # Flag system (placeholder)
│   ├── Player/            # Player character (placeholder)
│   ├── Calendar/          # Season management (placeholder)
│   └── Utilities/         # Shared utilities
├── Sports/
│   ├── _Shared/           # Base classes for all sports
│   └── Basketball/
│       ├── Gameplay/      # Basketball game logic
│       ├── Stats/         # Basketball calculations
│       └── Flags/         # Basketball-specific flags
├── HubWorld/              # Hub world systems (placeholder)
│   ├── Buildings/
│   ├── Navigation/
│   └── UI/
├── Management/            # Team management (placeholder)
│   ├── TeamManagement/
│   ├── Events/
│   ├── Training/
│   └── Scouting/
└── UI/
    ├── Shared/
    ├── Hub/               # Hub UI (HubMenuController)
    ├── Management/
    └── Sports/
```

### Namespace Changes

| Old Namespace | New Namespace | Files Affected |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| `Sportland.Core` | `Sportland.Core.GameManagement` | CoreGameManager.cs, ISportModule.cs |
| `Sportland.Core` | `Sportland.Core.Athlete` | Athlete.cs |
| `Sportland.Basketball` | `Sportland.Sports.Basketball.Gameplay` | BasketballPlayer.cs, Ball.cs, Hoop.cs, BasketballGameController.cs |
| `Sportland.Basketball` | `Sportland.Sports.Basketball.Stats` | ShotOutcomeCalculator.cs, ShotMissCalculator.cs |
| `Sportland.UI` | `Sportland.UI.Hub` | HubMenuController.cs |

### Files Moved

#### Core Systems
- ✅ `Core/CoreGameManager.cs` → `Core/GameManagement/CoreGameManager.cs`
- ✅ `Core/ISportModule.cs` → `Core/GameManagement/ISportModule.cs`
- ✅ `Core/Athlete.cs` → `Core/Athlete/Athlete.cs`

#### Basketball
- ✅ `Basketball/BasketballPlayer.cs` → `Sports/Basketball/Gameplay/BasketballPlayer.cs`
- ✅ `Basketball/Ball.cs` → `Sports/Basketball/Gameplay/Ball.cs`
- ✅ `Basketball/Hoop.cs` → `Sports/Basketball/Gameplay/Hoop.cs`
- ✅ `Basketball/BasketballGameController.cs` → `Sports/Basketball/Gameplay/BasketballGameController.cs`
- ✅ `Basketball/ShotOutcomeCalculator.cs` → `Sports/Basketball/Stats/ShotOutcomeCalculator.cs`
- ✅ `Basketball/ShotMissCalculator.cs` → `Sports/Basketball/Stats/ShotMissCalculator.cs`

#### UI
- ✅ `UI/HubMenuController.cs` → `UI/Hub/HubMenuController.cs`

### New Placeholder Files Created

To support future development, the following placeholder classes were created with TODO markers:

1. **Core/Flags/FlagManager.cs** - Flag system infrastructure
2. **Core/Player/PlayerCharacter.cs** - Player-coach character system
3. **Core/Calendar/CalendarSystem.cs** - Multi-sport season management
4. **HubWorld/HubController.cs** - Hub world navigation
5. **Sports/_Shared/BaseSportModule.cs** - Base class for all sports

### Documentation Created

- **Assets/Scripts/README.md** - Complete code organization guide
- **MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md** (this file) - Migration details

## Impact on Unity Project

### ✅ Safe Changes
- **MonoBehaviours:** Unity tracks scripts by class name, not namespace - all GameObject references remain intact
- **ScriptableObjects:** Athlete assets will load correctly
- **Scene References:** No manual reattachment needed

### ⚠️ Expected on Next Unity Launch
- Unity will detect moved files and recompile
- Brief compilation time as namespaces update
- No errors expected - all using statements updated

### 🔍 To Verify in Unity
1. Open project in Unity
2. Check Console for compilation errors (should be none)
3. Verify CoreGameManager prefab references intact
4. Verify scene GameObjects still have scripts attached
5. Test HubWorld → Basketball scene transition

## Benefits of New Structure

### Scalability
- ✅ Easy to add new sports (Baseball, Football, etc.) - just copy Basketball structure
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (gameplay vs management vs UI)
- ✅ Modular systems can be developed independently

### Organization
- ✅ Namespaces match folder paths (industry standard)
- ✅ Related code grouped logically
- ✅ Easy to find specific functionality

### Future Development
- ✅ Placeholder systems ready for implementation
- ✅ Clear TODOs marking what needs to be built
- ✅ Base classes provide structure for new features

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Verify in Unity)
1. Open Unity and confirm no compilation errors
2. Test existing basketball gameplay
3. Verify hub world scene loads correctly

### Short-term (Implement Core Systems)
Based on the design document, priority implementation order:

1. **Flag System** (`Core/Flags/`)
   - Implement flag acquisition/removal
   - Create flag definitions (Ball Hog, Clutch Gene, etc.)
   - Implement weight system (Light, Medium, Heavy, Permanent)
   - Sport-specific vs universal flags

2. **Player Character** (`Core/Player/`)
   - Character creation UI
   - Class system (Superstar, Motivator, Tactician, etc.)
   - Skill vs management trade-offs

3. **Hub World Buildings** (`HubWorld/Buildings/`)
   - Arena selector for sports
   - Office for team management
   - Hospital, Cafe, Home buildings

4. **Calendar System** (`Core/Calendar/`)
   - Multi-sport season overlap
   - Schedule generation
   - Day progression

### Medium-term (Expand Gameplay)
5. **Management Systems** (`Management/`)
   - Team composition & chemistry
   - Training & development
   - Scouting system
   - Team building events

6. **Additional Sports** (`Sports/Baseball/`, etc.)
   - Baseball implementation using ISportModule
   - Football, Volleyball, etc.
   - Multi-sport athlete tracking

### Long-term (Polish)
7. Save/load system
8. Advanced progression & unlocks
9. Narrative/career mode
10. Mobile/touch controls

## File Count Summary

- **C# Scripts:** 16 files (6 existing, 5 placeholder, 1 README)
- **Namespaces:** 8 distinct namespaces
- **Folders Created:** 25 new organizational folders
- **Sports Modules:** 1 complete (Basketball), structure ready for 5+ more

## Compatibility Notes

### Backwards Compatibility
- ❌ Old namespace references will break (expected, already updated)
- ✅ Unity asset GUIDs preserved
- ✅ Scene references intact
- ✅ Prefab references intact

### Migration Path for Others
If other developers are working on this project:

1. **Pull changes** from repository
2. **Unity will auto-detect** moved files via .meta files
3. **Recompile** will happen automatically
4. **No manual fixes** required

## Success Criteria

✅ All files moved to new locations
✅ All namespaces updated
✅ All using statements corrected
✅ Placeholder systems created
✅ Documentation written
✅ Clean folder structure
✅ Ready for Unity compilation
